# Lookoot: Empowering Local Business Discovery

Lookoot is an innovative Android application that bridges the digital divide between consumers and local businesses. Developed as part of my MSc Software Development dissertation at the University of Glasgow, this platform leverages modern mobile technology and location-based services to make local shopping as convenient as major e-commerce platforms while supporting community economies.

- Real-time inventory tracking and updates
- Secure user authentication and profile management
- Interactive map integration with store locations
- Store profile and inventory management for business owners
- Customer review and rating system
- Direct messaging between customers and stores
- Personalized product recommendations
